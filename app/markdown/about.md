##About

The inspiration for this project was from [bugheard](http://bugheard.com), As feedback is an essential component in a project lifetime, there need to be an open source server/client software that does this well. As a result we developed something we could reuse in all our projects.

As the project needs flexibility it called for an embedable snipplet which can be copied to any webpage and feedback can be accuired from the visitors. The system is portable as the server can be deployed on any server as long as it matches the specification.

Using the process in our project and working out we thought of sharing with the open source community. This will improve the project immensly and serve others in there projects as well.

Finally the UI needs to be configurable to support fixed positioning, inline and also have a remote trigger. This makes it usable on desktop, tablet and mobile platforms.
